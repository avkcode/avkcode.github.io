America keeps trying to turn Venezuela into a story with a clean ending. Find the villain, flip a switch, watch democracy return. It is a comforting fantasy for cable news. It is also a great way to keep repeating the same mistakes.

Nicolás Maduro sits on top of a political system that has spent years hollowing out institutions, squeezing opposition, and betting the country’s future on a shrinking circle of loyalists. Call it socialist, call it authoritarian, call it kleptocratic. What matters is the result: power concentrates, accountability disappears, and ordinary people pay in inflation, scarcity, and the choice between staying and leaving.

Donald Trump’s approach to Venezuela, like much of his foreign policy, treated the problem as a branding exercise. Maximum pressure sounds tough, and sometimes it is politically useful to point at a collapsing country and say: this is what happens when the other side runs things. But sanctions and rhetorical thunder do not produce a functioning opposition, a credible electoral path, or a state that can actually deliver basics. Pressure can be a tool. It is not a strategy by itself.

The deeper trap is that Venezuela becomes a prop in American arguments. On the right, it is used as a scarecrow for “socialism.” On the left, it is sometimes treated as a case study that must be explained away to protect domestic ambitions. Both moves are lazy. Venezuela is not a morality play about a single ideology. It is a lesson about institutions, incentives, corruption, and how hard it is to rebuild trust once a country’s politics become a winner-take-all fight.

If the goal is a Venezuela that is freer and less desperate, the U.S. should focus on outcomes, not chest-thumping. Support credible election monitoring and negotiated off ramps where possible. Target individual bad actors more precisely than broad measures that spill pain onto civilians. And be honest about trade-offs, including the temptation to treat Venezuelan oil as a shortcut when energy prices hurt at home.

Nobody gets a clean ending. But we can stop pretending that slogans are policy.
