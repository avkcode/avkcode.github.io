This repo is a personal blog (Jekyll + GitHub Pages) with a simple, functional design inspired by `/Users/antonkrylov/work/cisa/DESIGN.md`.

## Goals
- Keep the site fast, readable, and low-noise.
- Prioritize clear writing over cleverness.
- Separate facts from opinion, and label uncertainty.

## Design constraints
- Minimal UI chrome, glassy light surfaces, one muted accent.
- Good typography and line length (60–70 chars where possible).
- Accessibility first: visible focus, high contrast, respect reduced motion.

## Writing guidelines (posts)
- Topics: politics, life, and practical reflection.
- Tone: direct, concrete, fair-minded. Avoid performative snark.
- Prefer short paragraphs, specific claims, and plain language.
- When making factual claims that could be disputed, include a source link.
- If something depends on current events or “latest” info, verify with a web lookup before asserting it.
- Avoid defamation: describe actions and policies, not invented motives; distinguish allegation from verified fact.

## Repo conventions
- Posts live in `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
- Prefer small, focused edits. Don’t reformat unrelated files.
